   "source": "## Extending Your Code Reviewer: Architectural Patterns\n\nNow that you've built a solid code reviewer using core patterns, here's how you could extend it using the other patterns from the lecture:\n\n### 🔄 Sequential Workflows with Gates\n\nYour current reviewer could add quality gates between stages:\n\n```python\nasync def review_with_gates(code: str):\n    # Gate 1: Is it valid Python?\n    if not is_valid_python(code):\n        return {\"error\": \"Invalid Python syntax\"}\n    \n    # Gate 2: Basic quality check\n    basic_issues = check_basic_quality(code)\n    if len(basic_issues) > 10:\n        return {\"error\": \"Too many basic issues\", \"issues\": basic_issues}\n    \n    # Gate 3: Security check\n    security_issues = await check_security(code)\n    if has_critical_issues(security_issues):\n        return {\"error\": \"Critical security issues\", \"issues\": security_issues}\n    \n    # Only if all gates pass, do expensive analysis\n    return await full_analysis(code)\n```\n\n**When to use**: When you need guaranteed quality checkpoints and want to fail fast on obvious problems.\n\n### 📋 Planning and Decomposition\n\nFor large codebases, add a planning phase:\n\n```python\nasync def review_large_codebase(files: List[str]):\n    # Step 1: LLM creates review plan\n    plan = await llm.create_plan(f\"Review strategy for {len(files)} files\")\n    # Output: [\"1. Review interfaces\", \"2. Check dependencies\", \"3. Analyze performance\"]\n    \n    # Step 2: Execute each subtask\n    results = []\n    for task in plan.tasks:\n        result = await execute_review_task(task, files)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Step 3: Synthesize findings\n    final_report = await llm.synthesize(results)\n    return final_report\n```\n\n**When to use**: Reviewing entire modules, packages, or projects with 20+ files.\n\n### 👥 Supervisor Architecture (Use Sparingly!)\n\nFor complex polyglot projects:\n\n```python\nclass SupervisorReviewer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.supervisor = LLM(\"supervisor\")\n        self.experts = {\n            \"python\": PythonExpert(),\n            \"javascript\": JavaScriptExpert(),\n            \"sql\": SQLExpert(),\n            \"docker\": DockerExpert()\n        }\n    \n    async def review_project(self, project_files):\n        # Supervisor decides which experts to consult\n        for file in project_files:\n            expert_type = self.supervisor.classify(file)\n            expert = self.experts[expert_type]\n            \n            # Expert reviews their domain\n            review = await expert.review(file)\n            \n            # Supervisor integrates feedback\n            self.supervisor.integrate(review)\n        \n        return self.supervisor.final_report()\n```\n\n**When to use**: Multi-language projects, microservices, or when different team members need different expertise.\n\n### 💰 Cost and Performance Implications\n\n| Pattern | Latency | Cost | Complexity | Use When |\n|---------|---------|------|------------|----------|\n| **Current (Single + Parallel)** | ~2s | ~$0.02 | Low | Single files, quick reviews |\n| **Sequential with Gates** | ~1-3s | ~$0.01-0.03 | Medium | Need quality guarantees |\n| **Planning & Decomposition** | ~5-10s | ~$0.05-0.10 | Medium | Large codebases |\n| **Supervisor Multi-Agent** | ~10-30s | ~$0.50+ | High | Complex, multi-language projects |\n\n### 🎯 Decision Framework\n\n```python\ndef choose_review_pattern(code_metrics):\n    if code_metrics.lines < 500:\n        return \"basic_parallel\"  # What you built\n    \n    elif code_metrics.languages == 1 and code_metrics.lines < 2000:\n        return \"sequential_gates\"  # Add checkpoints\n    \n    elif code_metrics.files > 10:\n        return \"planning_decomposition\"  # Break into subtasks\n    \n    elif code_metrics.languages > 2 or code_metrics.complexity == \"high\":\n        return \"supervisor_architecture\"  # Multiple specialists\n    \n    else:\n        return \"basic_parallel\"  # Default to simple\n```\n\n### 🔧 MCP Integration Concept\n\nIf you wanted to package your reviewer as an MCP server:\n\n```python\n# Conceptual MCP server definition\nmcp_server = {\n    \"name\": \"code-reviewer\",\n    \"tools\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"review_code\",\n            \"description\": \"Review Python code for issues\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"code\": \"string\",\n                \"review_type\": [\"quick\", \"thorough\", \"security\"]\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"resources\": [\n        {\n            \"uri\": \"reviewer://config\",\n            \"description\": \"Review configuration and rules\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# Any LLM could then use your reviewer:\nresponse = llm.use_mcp_tool(\"code-reviewer\", \"review_code\", code=my_code)\n```\n\nThis would let your reviewer work with ANY LLM system that supports MCP!",
