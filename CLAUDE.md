# Agentic Architectures

This repository contains a set of lecture notes/slides used in a presentation about building reliable agentic AI systems.

The audience for the lecture is a group students in their final semester of masters in data science program.

The slides are build using sli.dev (mcp__context7 library id slidev)

We also use the neversink theme, which is documented in @neversink-docs-compressed.md

## Intial prompt

The initial prompt that was used to draft the slides is contained in @initial_prompt.md

## Guidelines

- Prefer simple markup containing as little HTML/css as possible
- Employ the principle of progressive disclosure
- Follow the key references outlined in the initial prompt
- Prefer the neversink `top-title` or `top-title-two-cols` layouts for content slides.
    - For `top-title` Make use `:: title ::` and `:: content ::` slots accordingly, (not `:: default ::`)
